### What is Twinbound?
TwinBound is 2.5D platformer game with a riveting story.

Together with a friend, you play as a set of twins held captive by scientists in a mysterious underground lab. Within the lab you are subjected to a multitude of scientific experiments to evaluate the mysterious connection between twins. Both of you yearn to escape,  to return to the surface world. An opportunity appears, and now you and your twin must work  together to climb to the top of the lab.

However, not everything is as it seems. Your movements are not always your own, and it seems that this mysterious connection the scientists were talking about might actually exist.
